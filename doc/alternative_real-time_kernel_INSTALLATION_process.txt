Using Franka Robot in real time requires that your Linux kernel is supporting "PREEMPTIVE" mode, meaning tasks can be prioritized and interrupted as needed.

To do that, Franka documentation gives a tutorial here :https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html 
HOWEVER!!! This tutorial didnt work on ubuntu 18.04 when I tried (Eugene, 06.08.2020). 

Instead, there is an alternative installation process, described here:
https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka/issues/62


Important note:
Installation is not automatically applied to the current Kernel. Instead, there is another Kernel that has to be chosen to boot in GRUB boot menu.
Here is how to do it:


1. To open GRUB menu, press ESC when system boots (seeing "Ubuntu" loading screen means you didnt make it in time. Restart, try again)
	1.1 Or modify /etc/default/grub text file. Set values: 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu' and 'GRUB_TIMEOUT=5' (or some other number in seconds)
	If unclear, read instructions in this post:
	https://askubuntu.com/questions/16042/how-to-get-to-the-grub-menu-at-boot-time

2. In GRUB loader, go to "Advanced Ubuntu Options" and select your newly installed linux kernel (probably the one that contains "rt" at the end of the name.

3. (Not needed) It is most likely possible to set this kernel to boot by default, havent done that yet.
