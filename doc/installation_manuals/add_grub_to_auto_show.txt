
1. To open GRUB menu, press ESC when system boots (seeing "Ubuntu" loading screen means you didnt make it in time. Restart, try again)
	1.1 Or modify /etc/default/grub text file. Set values: 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu' and 'GRUB_TIMEOUT=5' (or some other number in seconds)
	If unclear, read instructions in this post:
	https://askubuntu.com/questions/16042/how-to-get-to-the-grub-menu-at-boot-time

2. In GRUB loader, go to "Advanced Ubuntu Options" and select your newly installed linux kernel, probably the one that contains "rt" (real-time) at the end of the name.

3. It is most likely possible to set this kernel to boot by default, havent done that yet.
